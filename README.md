![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dab599b8-ad0d-4d41-90fc-66cfcc13f85c)


## Introduction

This project contains the analysis (Linear Regression) of the Red Wine dataset, downloaded from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data as a `winequality-red.csv` file.

The analysis focuses on building an explanatory linear regression model to identify the key factors that determine wine quality ratings. This multivariate analysis examines relationships between:

**Chemical Properties:** Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, sulfur dioxide levels, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content <br>
**Quality Ratings:** Expert evaluations on a scale from 0-10 (actual range 3-8 in the dataset)

The primary goal is to quantify how specific wine chemistry characteristics impact quality perceptions, providing insights that could inform winemaking decisions and quality control processes.

## Dataset Information

The Wine Quality dataset contains physicochemical and sensory data for 1,599 samples of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" red wine. This dataset was created by Paulo Cortez, Ant√≥nio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos, and Jos√© Reis in 2009, as documented in their paper "Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties." (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377)

**1. fixed acidity:** The concentration of non-volatile acids in the wine (primarily tartaric acid), measured in g/dm¬≥. These acids come primarily from grapes and remain relatively stable throughout the winemaking process.

**2. volatile acidity:** The amount of acetic acid in the wine, measured in g/dm¬≥. High levels of volatile acidity can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste.

**3. citric acid:** The concentration of citric acid in the wine, measured in g/dm¬≥. Citric acid can add freshness and flavor to wines when present in small quantities.

**4. residual sugar:** The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, measured in g/dm¬≥. It's rare to find wines with less than 1 g/L, and wines with greater than 45 g/L are considered sweet.

**5. chlorides:** The salt content in the wine, measured in g/dm¬≥. High chloride concentrations can give wine a salty taste.

**6. free sulfur dioxide:** The free form of SO‚ÇÇ that exists in equilibrium between molecular SO‚ÇÇ and bisulfite ion, measured in mg/dm¬≥. It prevents microbial growth and oxidation.

**7. total sulfur dioxide:** The sum of free and bound forms of SO‚ÇÇ, measured in mg/dm¬≥. In low concentrations, SO‚ÇÇ is mostly undetectable in wines, but at free SO‚ÇÇ concentrations over 50 ppm, it becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.

**8. density:** The density of the wine, measured in g/cm¬≥. This is close to that of water depending on the alcohol and sugar content.

**9. pH:** Describes how acidic or basic the wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic). Most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.

**10. sulphates:** The amount of potassium sulphate in the wine, measured in g/dm¬≥. Sulphates act as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.

**11. alcohol:** The percentage of alcohol content in the wine by volume.

**12. quality:** The target variable, based on sensory data. It's the median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts, rated on a scale from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent).


## Target Variable, Modeling Approach üìä and Hypothesis Testing Framework üß™

The target variable is **wine quality** (`quality`) representing expert sensory evaluations based on the median rating from at least three wine experts. This ordinal variable ranges from 3 to 8 in our dataset, with most wines rated between 5-6.

**<ins>Model Development Strategy:</ins>**

  **1. Initial Model:** Focus on hypothesis-driven variables (alcohol and volatile acidity) <br>
  **2. Expanded Model:** Use backward selection to identify additional significant predictors <br>
  **3. Model Comparison:** Evaluate both approaches to understand incremental value of additional variables

**<ins>Hypothesis Testing:</ins>**

* **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** There is no relationship between alcohol content, volatile acidity, and wine quality (the coefficients of alcohol and volatile acidity in predicting wine quality equal zero). <br>

* **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** Higher alcohol content and lower volatile acidity are independently associated with higher perceived wine quality.


## üöÄ Analytical Plan

**1. Data Loading and Preparation:**

  * Load Portuguese red wine quality dataset (1,599 samples)
  * Remove duplicate observations to ensure data integrity
  * Apply outlier detection and removal using z-score methodology
  * Validate data quality and completeness <br />

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

  * Analyze distribution of wine quality ratings and chemical properties
  * Create correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables
  * Examine multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
  * Visualize key relationships between predictors and wine quality <br />

**3. Hypothesis Formulation and Testing:**

  * Formulate hypothesis: Higher alcohol content and lower volatile acidity independently predict higher wine quality
  * Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets
  * Build initial linear regression model with hypothesis variables (alcohol, volatile acidity)
  * Test statistical significance using p-values and confidence intervals <br />

**4. Model Development and Selection:**

  * Apply backward selection starting with correlated variables
  * Systematically remove non-significant predictors (p > 0.05)
  * Compare initial hypothesis-driven model vs. expanded backward selection model
  * Evaluate model assumptions through residual analysis and diagnostic plots <br />

**5. Model Validation and Performance:**

  * Test both models on hold-out dataset to assess generalizability
  * Calculate R-squared and RMSE metrics for model comparison
  * Create actual vs. predicted visualizations
  * Compare model performance on raw vs. cleaned data <br />

**6. Results Interpretation and Conclusions:**

  * Interpret coefficient magnitudes, directions, and confidence intervals
  * Assess practical significance of chemical properties on wine quality
  * Address original hypothesis with statistical evidence
  * Identify limitations and suggest improvements for future analysis
  * Provide actionable insights for wine production and quality assessment

7. Follow these steps to open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   
   Start the Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
     jupyter notebook Red_Wine_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
 This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.


## Importing the original dataset into Jupyter Notebooks for Analysis:

* Download the Red Wine dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data as a `winequality-red.csv` file and save the file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file
* Load the dataset into a DataFrame in Jupyter Notebooks with the necessary packages:
```bash
import pandas as pd
# Load dataset into Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv')

#Display the first 5 rows of the dataset
df.head()
```
* Proceed with data inspection lookiing for duplicates, missing values and outliers before proceeding with the exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Visualizations

The Jupyter Notebook contains visualizations and graphs plotted with funtions that can be found in a separate `red_wine_functions.py` file. Each visualation function is called separately in the Jupyter Notebook file, e.g. when visualizing the distribution of players in each variant:

```bash
viz.plot_feature_distribution(df3)
```
If needed, `filename='feature_distribution.png` can be used to save each plot as a png. file for further use. If this is not needed it can be removed.

When running the Jupyter Notebook file, make sure the `red_wine_functions.py` function is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file to run the analysis successfully!
